# bussin!

Apps like Google Maps and Apple Maps often feel unreliable for bus riders. Arrival times jump, routes reset, and live information is hard to find. We wanted to build a bus-first app that makes checking your bus fast, clear, and trustworthy.

## What it does
Bussin makes transit easier by focusing on what matters most:
- Live, real-time bus location tracking
- Saved bus routes for daily commutes
- Instant arrival updates without re-planning trips

Unlike Google Maps, Bussin shows where buses actually are right now, helping users make better decisions at the stop.

## How we built it
- Flutter and Dart for cross-platform mobile development
- Kotlin for Android integration
- TransLink API for real-time bus data
- Google Maps Android SDK for map visualization
